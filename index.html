              <p>As a child, I gravitated towards challenging and interesting things. Whether it was climbing the tallest tree in our neighborhood or attending large family dinners at my Taiwanese neighbors home, I found myself venturing to places my peers would not. Driven by a passion for experiences, people, and uncertainty my life has been an amazing adventure personally and professionally.

<br><br>Personally, I like to find opportunities that put me in uncomfortable situations. I recently climbed Mt. Fuji alone after a full day of work and severe jet lag. I wanted to explore an active volcano that is the source of inspiration for countless artists, poets, and pilgrims. I instinctively chose the route with the greatest difficulty. The most memorable point of the climb wasn't the summit to my surprise, but the hours of collaboration and comradery with other climbers also making the pilgrimage.

<br><br>Professionally I find uncertainty more attractive than inertia. New ideas, creative solutions, and process innovation keeps me up at night and jolts me out of bed early in the morning. My performance is best when there is a steep learning curve, and if the stakes are high. Having had the opportunity to work on "The Most Interesting Man" campaign, I realized a lot about myself. I enjoy being part of collaborative teams, love winning, and relish creating disruptive strategies. I recall watching SNL spoof our work and thought "we had no idea if any of this would work," that was the gamble and the thrill it.
